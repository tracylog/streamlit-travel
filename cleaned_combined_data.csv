10,2020,"When I filled out TA, put in information that was asked again twice."
10,2020,Favourite vacation spot.
10,2020,A little less hand sanitizer mandators use at the airport. Don't want to be forced to use every 20 ft when it just dried.
10,2020,If you are tested and is negative quarantine for only 7 days instead of plus 7 days.
10,2020,The taxes are too high. Prices are too high for a small bag of chips. Why are they $3? Wendys meal was $12 too high.

11,2020,"There is a great need for better internet service, especially during this pandemic with almost everything being done online."
11,2020,Jamaica is beautiful with easy and awesome people.
11,2020,Get rid of resorts and push locally owned establishments to get more money in the hands of the people.
11,2020,Your prices are too high for visitors forcing us not to purchase items.
11,2020,5th trip to Jamaica and always a pleasure - wonderful time.
11,2020,"Had an amazing honeymoon. Thanks, Jamaica."

11,2020,Better inform travelers of restrictions especially since poor cell service makes research hard.
11,2020,Stay the course.
11,2020,Our only concern was lack of social distancing in immigration or customs line.
